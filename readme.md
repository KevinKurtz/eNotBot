# e-Not Bot

e-Not Bot (e-Notifications Bot) was created to automate and anticipate my needs across the web. Focused primarily on Discord, the bot also features web services, Alexa skills, and general script running. It is my interface to interact with the world and my server. Planned integrations for more services.

## Installation

GIT this folder. You don't need a virtual environment, but you should create one, as python dependencies are a nightmare.
Use the built in configuration file example to set up the bot. Use \__init__.py in plugins to turn the plugins on/off by commenting them out.

## Usage

```
source /path/to/bot/env/bin/activate && /path/to/bot/eNotBot.py 1>>/path/to/bot/log.log 2>&1 &'
```

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. This is a personal bot to automate my life, but if it helps you or you have changes, great!
